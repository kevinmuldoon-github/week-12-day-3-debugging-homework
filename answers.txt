1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
--------------------------------------------

A breakpoint allow us to suspect the execusion of our application at a specific point in a file.

This gives you greater control when debugging as it lets you work through code line by line or even function by function.

The current state of objects and variables can also be easily viewed using breakpoints.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, it does not. The program will stop executing in the line above the breakpoint.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
--------------------------------------------

The step over button that is available in the IDE lets you progress to the next line. 

You can also change the breakpoint manually if you wish i.e. manually remove breakpoints and add new breakpoints.

4. What does the step into command do?
--------------------------------------------

Step in will let you jump into a function/method and debug it line by line.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluate expression loads a box which lets is run specific expressions. For example, the result when calling a method.

In code fragment mode, you can evaulate multiple lines of code, assign variables for evaulation and more. This gives you more flexibility when testing expressions and methods.
